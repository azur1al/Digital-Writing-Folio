## Week One Readings

1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)


2. The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)


3. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)

  
4. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)
Shade was almost like a nostalgia trip to me. I haven't 'played' any interactive fiction like it for a while now, mostly playing through visual novels instead, so it was nice to go back to the beginnings.
