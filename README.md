### The Electronic Literature Collection
<p>This week we took a look at the  <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/">Electronic Literature Collection</a> and wrote about a few of the pieces that piqued our interest. I chose <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/larsen__carving_in_possibilities.html">Carving in Possibilities</a> by Deena Larsen with sounds from Matt Hansen (Vol. 1), <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/2/works/michel_ah.html">Ah</a> by K Michel and Dirk Vis (Vol. 2), <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=with-those-we-love-alive">With Those We Love Alive by Porpentine</a> (Vol. 3), and <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/4/the-fetch">The Fetch</a> by Jerome Fletcher (Vol. 4).</p>

<p>Carving in Possibilities is a short but intriguing piece of e-literature wherein the reader hovers their mouse over a blurry image, revealing snippets of text as they move until their carving is complete and the image is clear. I enjoyed their use of audio in partnership with the evolving image. The loud and sudden, highly repetitive sounds alongside the background audio create a slightly eerie atmosphere as you persevere. I enjoyed the non-linearity of the story and the kind of ‘reader choice’ through the mouse direction in influencing the kind of story revealed. I thought it kind of funny that the faster you moved your mouse, the faster the image cleared and the faster the sounds blurted out at you. Not easy listening, I must say, but entertaining nonetheless. Of course, this piece could not be realised without the digital devices employed (being the utilisation of the mouse and the clearing of the image based upon reader activity).</p>

<p>*Ah* is an incredibly interesting piece of e-literature that is reliant on the transience of its text. I found the way in which the words overlapped each other as the letters moved across the screen at slightly different rates to one another was really interesting and incredibly fun when you managed to figure out some of the more difficult jumbles. I found it even more so entertaining when the strand of text split into different strands that moved their way up and down before rejoining themselves. This piece relies entirely upon it being digital to be realised.</p>

<p>With Those We Love Alive is a fun and compelling piece of e-literature that relies heavily on the input of the reader. Winding my way through all of the many choices offered to me was incredibly rewarding, and I thought that though the music was incredibly repetitive, it was a nice atmospheric detail. Though this piece could be realised within a book, it would be much too complicated for most to bother reading through, the digital realm making it easy to navigate and having the bonus of pretty colours and fun music.</p>

<p>*The Fetch* is an interesting piece of e-literature that uses a similar mechanic to that within Carving in Possibilities wherein the reader hovers their mouse over text to reveal new text (as pictured above). Almost every piece of original text (white in the picture above) has additional text (grey) that can be discovered when hovering over it.</p>

### Glitch - Coding Playground
<p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/azur1al/coding-playground-experiment</p>

<p>This week we had a look at Glitch and ‘remixed’ a coding playground. Working with HTML, CSS and Javascript for the first time, I had a lot of fun playing around with the code and testing out how different parts worked. I mostly ended up working independently on this, following my interests primarily and solving the puzzle that was the foreign code language via the hints left in the notes. I found the challenge a lot of fun and incredibly rewarding when the code I altered didn’t collapse the entire site. </p>

<p>For my coding playground I decided to try and stick with a theme, and as I had just recently rediscovered my favourite flower language website, I decided to make that a central theme. It definitely helped as a guiding force and inspired a bit of the text that was written as a result.</p>

<p>My favourite card to work on was definitely the haiku, I had a lot of fun playing around with the re-ordering of the inputted text and creating new stories with each remix. I also really enjoyed the Taroko Gorge remix and figuring out how the code worked.</p>

<p>I think that working with Glitch is definitely something that I will continue to do after this semester, it’s incredibly user-friendly and a lot of fun to work with!</p>

### Glitch - E-Literature Reflections and a Dadaist Poem
<p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/azur1al/dadaist-poem</p>

<p>This week we had a look at <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge">Taroko Gorge by Nick Monfort</a>, <a href="https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/">The Gathering Cloud</a> by J R Carpenter, <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution">First Draft of the Revolution</a> by Emily Short and Liza Daly, and <a href="https://pr-if.org/play/shade/">Shade</a> by Ampe R. Sand (Andrew Plotkin).</p>
  
<p>Out of these four the piece that stood out to me the most was Shade, as it was most familiar to the pieces of e-literature that I had encountered when I was younger. I love the way that information is revealed to you and the control that you as the reader have over how the story progresses, even when it means triple checking the same aspect over and over just in case you’ve missed something, or spending ages in a single room because you can’t figure out what triggers the next segment. Though most pieces like Shade don’t have much to offer in the realm of imagery and audio, it still offers a unique experience each time you play and allows you to have lots of fun with how you go about working your way through the storyline.</p>
  
<p>I also really enjoyed The Gathering Cloud and its use of imagery and evolving websites. I really love how the text was formatted and revealed to the reader, how each image held meaning, and how combined they both created an incredibly intriguing and moving story in which you as the reader feel to be a great part of. It’s an incredibly interesting way of telling a story that couldn’t be executed via analogue means.</p>
  
<p>I also had a lot of fun with First Draft of the Revolution, which had a lot of interesting moments with shifting text at the reader’s actions. I thought that the way it allowed for so much of the reader’s control in what was written was especially interesting, especially with the story’s content.</p>
  
<p>This week we also remixed a dadaist poem via Glitch which was a lot of fun! I put in a lot of different pieces of my writing and ended up keeping one that I thought was the most fun which you can see the dadaist poem version of on the left-hand side! It was a lot simpler than I thought it would initially be, but still a lot of fun and definitely something I’d like to try and play with a bit more. It reminded me a lot of Taroko Gorge.</p>

### Twine Part One
<p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/azur1al/digital-writing-twine-task</p>

<p>This week we had a look at the software Twine! I had a lot of fun playing around with it, though because I was using a piece of writing that I had used to experiment with formatting, I ended up spending most of my time figuring out how to indent text like I have for the “one for him, one from him” part (&emsp;). I thought it was really interesting that you could change the way that links looked, mine being bold and underlined, depending on your artistic choices or practical needs.</p>
 
<p>I definitely think that Twine is something that I will be using in the future, the UI is pretty user-friendly, and though a lot of the online handbooks/guides are outdated there is still a plethora of tutorials from passionate users of the software that are incredibly helpful – especially if you’re looking for something a bit more obscure like indentation. I had a lot of fun making this piece and look forwards to using this software again in the future!</p>

### Bitsy and Inform7
<p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/azur1al/bitsy-test</p>

<p>This week I had a lot of fun testing out Bitsy and Inform7! I hadn’t before used either of the programs myself, but I had read through/played through pieces of interactive fiction that had been created with them, so I was really excited to see the behind the scenes of how they work. I have to say that Bitsy was a lot more complicated than I thought! I have a lot more respect for the Bitsy pieces I have read/played in the past now, especially after learning that each tile has to be drawn and placed individually rather than being able to draw across the entire background. Though I initially was having trouble deciding whether I wanted to use Bitsy, Twine, or Glitch for my final project, this experiment definitely cleared up for me which I will be choosing (Glitch and Twine). As much as I loved playing with Bitsy and making the short little scene I did, I think that it would take me far too much time to create something that I would be satisfied with the end product of with Bitsy over Twine and Glitch.</p>
  
<p>Though I was the only one to stay, I definitely had fun playing around with and learning about how Inform7 operates. It actually wasn’t as complicated as I thought it would be, but I imagine it would only get more and more difficult to keep track of everything as your piece grows. Whilst it isn’t something that I will be using for my final project, it’s definitely something I’d be interested using for another project in the future. As I have said, I have read through a lot of pieces that have been created using Inform7, and despite it being older now, I still think it’s incredibly interesting in the way that it operates and the way in which it allows readers to interact with what they are reading.</p>

### Reflection on Feedback and Peer Presentations

<p>One of the major points of feedback I received was concern over the fact that people would not want to download locked ZIP files in fear of viruses or other malicious items. Initially I decided that I would move from uploading the ZIP files to itch.io for people to download to deciding to upload them to a Proton Drive linked to the Proton email that Laura uses to email Emma. This way there would be a bit more security for each party involved. However, I eventually decided to move away from ZIP files altogether to make the overall experience a bit smoother.</p>

<p>Though I eventually decided to not keep the ZIP files, I still wanted the reader to have to solve puzzles to get the ‘passwords’ (the coordinates). So, I decided to make some Twine stories to relay the information that can only be accessed after you have obtained the corresponding person’s coordinates. Technically, you do not need to access these Twines to know what happened, you can deduce it for yourself, so I suppose it’s more of an easter egg for people who are determined to learn everything they can.</p>

<p>Once you have found the coordinates of one of the missing persons: -38.1064396, 145.1540782</p>
<p>You can add them to the end of the blog’s url: https://kaitlyns-blog.glitch.me/3810643961451540782.html</p>
<p>Which, depending on which character’s coordinates you obtained, will take you to one of the Twines below that reveals what would have been in one of the ZIP files.</p>
  
<p>Another piece of feedback was that some of the solutions to the puzzles would not be completely evident to those that are not experienced in working through these kind of mystery stories before. As I had already set up an email address for Laura, I decided it would be a good idea to set up a kind of auto-response in case anyone tried emailing it, which contains an offer for help if anyone is stuck.</p>
<p>Of course, because I am thinking of uploading this to itch.io, people can upload comments on the home page of this piece and ask questions if they are stuck, and hopefully I’ll be able to help them out without completely giving the answer away.</p>
