# Digital Writing Folio

## - Week One -
### The Electronic Literature Collection
<p>This week we took a look at the  <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/">Electronic Literature Collection</a> and wrote about a few of the pieces that piqued our interest. I chose <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/larsen__carving_in_possibilities.html">Carving in Possibilities</a> by Deena Larsen with sounds from Matt Hansen (Vol. 1), <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/2/works/michel_ah.html">Ah</a> by K Michel and Dirk Vis (Vol. 2), <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=with-those-we-love-alive">With Those We Love Alive by Porpentine</a> (Vol. 3), and <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/4/the-fetch">The Fetch</a> by Jerome Fletcher (Vol. 4).</p>

<p>Carving in Possibilities is a short but intriguing piece of e-literature wherein the reader hovers their mouse over a blurry image, revealing snippets of text as they move until their carving is complete and the image is clear. I enjoyed their use of audio in partnership with the evolving image. The loud and sudden, highly repetitive sounds alongside the background audio create a slightly eerie atmosphere as you persevere. I enjoyed the non-linearity of the story and the kind of ‘reader choice’ through the mouse direction in influencing the kind of story revealed. I thought it kind of funny that the faster you moved your mouse, the faster the image cleared and the faster the sounds blurted out at you. Not easy listening, I must say, but entertaining nonetheless. Of course, this piece could not be realised without the digital devices employed (being the utilisation of the mouse and the clearing of the image based upon reader activity).</p>

<p>*Ah* is an incredibly interesting piece of e-literature that is reliant on the transience of its text. I found the way in which the words overlapped each other as the letters moved across the screen at slightly different rates to one another was really interesting and incredibly fun when you managed to figure out some of the more difficult jumbles. I found it even more so entertaining when the strand of text split into different strands that moved their way up and down before rejoining themselves. This piece relies entirely upon it being digital to be realised.</p>

<p>With Those We Love Alive is a fun and compelling piece of e-literature that relies heavily on the input of the reader. Winding my way through all of the many choices offered to me was incredibly rewarding, and I thought that though the music was incredibly repetitive, it was a nice atmospheric detail. Though this piece could be realised within a book, it would be much too complicated for most to bother reading through, the digital realm making it easy to navigate and having the bonus of pretty colours and fun music.</p>

<p>*The Fetch* is an interesting piece of e-literature that uses a similar mechanic to that within Carving in Possibilities wherein the reader hovers their mouse over text to reveal new text (as pictured above). Almost every piece of original text (white in the picture above) has additional text (grey) that can be discovered when hovering over it.</p>

### Glitch - Coding Playground
<p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/azur1al/coding-playground-experiment</p>

<p>This week we had a look at Glitch and ‘remixed’ a coding playground. Working with HTML, CSS and Javascript for the first time, I had a lot of fun playing around with the code and testing out how different parts worked. I mostly ended up working independently on this, following my interests primarily and solving the puzzle that was the foreign code language via the hints left in the notes. I found the challenge a lot of fun and incredibly rewarding when the code I altered didn’t collapse the entire site. </p>

<p>For my coding playground I decided to try and stick with a theme, and as I had just recently rediscovered my favourite flower language website, I decided to make that a central theme. It definitely helped as a guiding force and inspired a bit of the text that was written as a result.</p>

<p>My favourite card to work on was definitely the haiku, I had a lot of fun playing around with the re-ordering of the inputted text and creating new stories with each remix. I also really enjoyed the Taroko Gorge remix and figuring out how the code worked.</p>

<p>I think that working with Glitch is definitely something that I will continue to do after this semester, it’s incredibly user-friendly and a lot of fun to work with!</p>

### Glitch - E-Literature Reflections and a Dadaist Poem
<p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/azur1al/dadaist-poem</p>

<p>This week we had a look at <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge">Taroko Gorge by Nick Monfort</a>, <a href="https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/">The Gathering Cloud</a> by J R Carpenter, <a href="https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution">First Draft of the Revolution</a> by Emily Short and Liza Daly, and <a href="https://pr-if.org/play/shade/">Shade</a> by Ampe R. Sand (Andrew Plotkin).</p>
  
<p>Out of these four the piece that stood out to me the most was Shade, as it was most familiar to the pieces of e-literature that I had encountered when I was younger. I love the way that information is revealed to you and the control that you as the reader have over how the story progresses, even when it means triple checking the same aspect over and over just in case you’ve missed something, or spending ages in a single room because you can’t figure out what triggers the next segment. Though most pieces like Shade don’t have much to offer in the realm of imagery and audio, it still offers a unique experience each time you play and allows you to have lots of fun with how you go about working your way through the storyline.</p>
  
<p>I also really enjoyed The Gathering Cloud and its use of imagery and evolving websites. I really love how the text was formatted and revealed to the reader, how each image held meaning, and how combined they both created an incredibly intriguing and moving story in which you as the reader feel to be a great part of. It’s an incredibly interesting way of telling a story that couldn’t be executed via analogue means.</p>
  
<p>I also had a lot of fun with First Draft of the Revolution, which had a lot of interesting moments with shifting text at the reader’s actions. I thought that the way it allowed for so much of the reader’s control in what was written was especially interesting, especially with the story’s content.</p>
  
<p>This week we also remixed a dadaist poem via Glitch which was a lot of fun! I put in a lot of different pieces of my writing and ended up keeping one that I thought was the most fun which you can see the dadaist poem version of on the left-hand side! It was a lot simpler than I thought it would initially be, but still a lot of fun and definitely something I’d like to try and play with a bit more. It reminded me a lot of Taroko Gorge.</p>

### Twine Part One
<p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/azur1al/digital-writing-twine-task</p>

<p>This week we had a look at the software Twine! I had a lot of fun playing around with it, though because I was using a piece of writing that I had used to experiment with formatting, I ended up spending most of my time figuring out how to indent text like I have for the “one for him, one from him” part (&emsp;). I thought it was really interesting that you could change the way that links looked, mine being bold and underlined, depending on your artistic choices or practical needs.</p>
 
<p>I definitely think that Twine is something that I will be using in the future, the UI is pretty user-friendly, and though a lot of the online handbooks/guides are outdated there is still a plethora of tutorials from passionate users of the software that are incredibly helpful – especially if you’re looking for something a bit more obscure like indentation. I had a lot of fun making this piece and look forwards to using this software again in the future!</p>

<br>

## - Week Five -
### Ergodic Literature
<p>Aarseth’s concept of Ergodic Literature was something that interested me personally as someone who has much more experience on the reader side of this kind of storytelling. It has given me a lot to consider about what I would like to do for my final project, how the way that I incorporate interactive elements can influence or interfere with a reader’s experience and perspective of the piece.</p>

<p>One of my favourite quotes was, “[w]eb text is close to that of a painting, where the artist may modify and revise the same work in a process that may take many years” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 81), which as someone who has come from a visual arts background to writing was a particularly interesting point. There is one artwork of mine, a costume, that I have been working on for near four years now, adding bits and pieces here and there as the years go by. Each year I think, ‘yes, this is it, I’ve finally finished it’, before I have another idea and it’s being changed again. I can only imagine that with something like interactive fiction, if I were to make something I would be continuously working on it for a very long time.</p>

<p>I was also incredibly taken by the idea that the author is the “only one who has full comprehension of the text’s composition at any time” (Aarseth, 1997, p. 81), something that again is incredibly interesting as someone who has read from interactive fiction more than I have written it. I think that, when thinking of interactive fiction that I have been the most interested in over the years, this has been one of the most alluring points of them – trying to find every possible scrap of information, every possible scene, every possible ending, to try and piece together the whole picture, that’s what I love the most about interactive fiction.</p>

<p>I also liked the idea that “[i]t may be argued that click-able words and menus subvert the lyrical genre aspect by inviting the user to play an (imagined) personal role in the production of a reading path” (Aarseth, 1997, pp. 85-86), again a lot of interactive fiction I enjoy are ones wherein you as a reader are a part of the world you are reading, you are a character as well as a reader, though they work best when they are subtle and not outright with it.</p>

<p>Overall I thought it was a very interesting reading with a lot of important points to consider as I continue on through this class.</p>

### Mapping Ideas
<p>When we discussed how we were mapping out our projects in class, I was able to talk about how I have been using Miro to map out both a timeline as well as a map of the website and its branches. Miro has been an incredibly useful tool for me for a long time in regard to planning out storylines. I’ve used it before in several larger projects where it was absolutely necessary to have a timeline map of the project that could be accessed by numerous people and will definitely use it again. It's been incredibly useful for this project and I'm glad that I've been able to use it.</p>

### Previous Student’s Work
<p>This week we took a look at some examples of previous students’ works. I especially enjoyed <a href="https://tannacat.github.io/final-proj-snow-season/">Snow Season</a> by Tanna Sulzberger, who had used Twine to create their piece. I really enjoyed the way that the piece was formatted, how the text faded from scene to scene, lingering on, and how the images for each scene played with the text. I thought that at some points though the text was a bit difficult to read thanks to the background image conflicting with the white text, it only added to the experience and made it all that more interesting to read. I really admired the way that the text had been formatted for this piece, especially considering the fact that I had tried so hard to figure out how to do my own formatting within Twine, I feel as though I was able to have an extra layer of understanding for the author of this piece and their probable struggles with the formatting.</p>

### Image Styling, Image Maps, and Audio in Twine
<p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/azur1al/digital-writing-image-map-test</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun working with the image mapping and background images for this Twine experiment! I’m not sure if image mapping is something that I will use for my final project but it’s definitely something fun to consider! I had a bit of trouble with the audio and ended up making three different versions of the Twine which either don’t work at all or only work in incredibly specific conditions I am not at all partial to. Such is code, I think.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking of using specific backgrounds on each of my twines in my final project to help to separate the different characters that they are referencing. I originally was going to have a different background for each twine, but I think that having some consistency will help the reader to feel a bit more grounded.</p>

<br>

## - Week Seven -
### Bitsy and Inform7
<p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/azur1al/bitsy-test</p>

<p>This week I had a lot of fun testing out Bitsy and Inform7! I hadn’t before used either of the programs myself, but I had read through/played through pieces of interactive fiction that had been created with them, so I was really excited to see the behind the scenes of how they work. I have to say that Bitsy was a lot more complicated than I thought! I have a lot more respect for the Bitsy pieces I have read/played in the past now, especially after learning that each tile has to be drawn and placed individually rather than being able to draw across the entire background. Though I initially was having trouble deciding whether I wanted to use Bitsy, Twine, or Glitch for my final project, this experiment definitely cleared up for me which I will be choosing (Glitch and Twine). As much as I loved playing with Bitsy and making the short little scene I did, I think that it would take me far too much time to create something that I would be satisfied with the end product of with Bitsy over Twine and Glitch.</p>
  
<p>Though I was the only one to stay, I definitely had fun playing around with and learning about how Inform7 operates. It actually wasn’t as complicated as I thought it would be, but I imagine it would only get more and more difficult to keep track of everything as your piece grows. Whilst it isn’t something that I will be using for my final project, it’s definitely something I’d be interested using for another project in the future. As I have said, I have read through a lot of pieces that have been created using Inform7, and despite it being older now, I still think it’s incredibly interesting in the way that it operates and the way in which it allows readers to interact with what they are reading.</p>

### Reflection on Feedback and Peer Presentations

<p>One of the major points of feedback I received was concern over the fact that people would not want to download locked ZIP files in fear of viruses or other malicious items. Initially I decided that I would move from uploading the ZIP files to itch.io for people to download to deciding to upload them to a Proton Drive linked to the Proton email that Laura uses to email Emma. This way there would be a bit more security for each party involved. However, I eventually decided to move away from ZIP files altogether to make the overall experience a bit smoother.</p>

<p>Though I eventually decided to not keep the ZIP files, I still wanted the reader to have to solve puzzles to get the ‘passwords’ (the coordinates). So, I decided to make some Twine stories to relay the information that can only be accessed after you have obtained the corresponding person’s coordinates. Technically, you do not need to access these Twines to know what happened, you can deduce it for yourself, so I suppose it’s more of an easter egg for people who are determined to learn everything they can.</p>

<p>Once you have found the coordinates of one of the missing persons: -38.1064396, 145.1540782</p>
<p>You can add them to the end of the blog’s url: https://kaitlyns-blog.glitch.me/3810643961451540782.html</p>
<p>Which, depending on which character’s coordinates you obtained, will take you to one of the Twines below that reveals what would have been in one of the ZIP files.</p>
  
<p>Another piece of feedback was that some of the solutions to the puzzles would not be completely evident to those that are not experienced in working through these kind of mystery stories before. As I had already set up an email address for Laura, I decided it would be a good idea to set up a kind of auto-response in case anyone tried emailing it, which contains an offer for help if anyone is stuck.</p>
<p>Of course, because I am thinking of uploading this to itch.io, people can upload comments on the home page of this piece and ask questions if they are stuck, and hopefully I’ll be able to help them out without completely giving the answer away.</p>
